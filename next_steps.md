## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK

**Start with Phase 1.1 - Fix Voltage**

Would you like me to:
1. **Fix the voltage violations** by implementing proper voltage control?
2. **Add contingency analysis** for N-1 security assessment?
3. **Optimize performance** for even larger systems?
4. **Add machine learning** for predictive capabilities?

The voltage issue is blocking realistic operation, so I recommend we tackle that first.
